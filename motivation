Identifying interfacial water sites:

Local water density fluctuations different for surface-water’s / bulk-water’s
Binding processes involve disrupting the surface-water interaction
surface-water interactions influence thermodynamics, kinetics of surface interactions, stability and phase behavior of surfaces in water
Characterize - disrupting the surface-water interactions
